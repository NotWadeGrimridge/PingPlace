# PingPlace

Control notification position on macOS.

**Note: I can't run Hackintosh anymore, so development is in a feature freeze. Users say the app works on macOS 26 just fine. If the app breaks, I can borrow my friends' Mac and fix it. Rest assured, new features will come when I can afford my own Macbook!**
